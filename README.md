# Profiteer

Ever sit around Orgrimmar/Ironforge/Dalaran with your stacks of crafting reagents and ask yourself "I wonder which of the many items I can craft will actually sell for more than what they cost to make?"

This service aims to answer that question, in a semi-reliable, but user unfriendly way (since I don't enjoy front-end work).

Note, it was only after naming this repo that I googled the name and discovered the existence of a site called wowprofiteer.com. Neither I nor this service are connected to them in any way, and I can't seem to connect to the site to determine if the functionality has any overlap. I seriously doubt this repo will get any attention, so I doubt it'll matter regardless.
